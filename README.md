Recruitment task
================

1. The task is to make tests pass and code work.
2. Feel free to add some structure to the code.
3. You are allowed to add extra files if it's needed for better design.
4. The only thing you cannot change are files: `item_test.rb` and `item.rb`, rest is up to you.

Good luck!
